#"To do" list app

##About
This is simple React application that provides possibility of adding, deleting and managing everyday tasks. It contains a form that allows the user to create a new task, and two sections. Both generate tasks list, but first obtains only active, undone tasks displayed in alphabetical order, while the second returns done tasks ordered by the date of their accomplishement. Plus, however the done tasks number is shown in the UI, only last three of them are listed.
