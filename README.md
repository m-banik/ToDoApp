# "To do" list app

## About
This is simple React application that provides possibility of adding, deleting and managing everyday tasks. It contains a form that allows the user to create a new task, and two sections. Both generate tasks list, but while the first obtains only active, undone tasks displayed in alphabetical order, the second returns done tasks ordered by the date of their accomplishment. Plus, however the done tasks number is shown in the UI, only last three of them are listed.
